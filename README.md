A trustless smart wallet vault with built-in automated ETH recovery.

Aeternum Core lets users store ETH in a self-sovereign vault, send and receive funds like a normal wallet, and configure a backup address with an inactivity timer. If the user goes silent beyond their chosen period — lost keys, death, incapacitation — Chainlink Automation transfers their ETH to the backup address automatically. No custodians. No admin backdoors. Just code.

## Architecture

Aeternum Core is a single-contract architecture. Each registered wallet has its own isolated vault within the contract — balances are tracked individually, never pooled. Chainlink Automation nodes monitor all registered vaults off-chain and execute recovery on-chain only when inactivity conditions are met.

```

## Trust Model

| Actor | Can Do | Cannot Do |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | Register, deposit, send, withdrawAll, ping, update config, cancel | Access other users' funds |
| **Chainlink Automation** | Call `performUpkeep` via the registered forwarder when inactivity conditions are met | Alter configs or redirect funds |
| **Anyone** | Call `checkUpkeep` (read-only, off-chain simulation) | Call `performUpkeep` once forwarder is set |
| **No one** | — | Pause recovery, upgrade the contract, or access user funds |

## How It Works

**1. Register**

The user calls `register()` with a backup address and inactivity period. ETH deposited at registration goes directly into their vault.

**2. Use the vault**

The vault behaves like a normal wallet. Users can `deposit()` ETH, `send()` ETH to any address, `withdrawAll()` back to themselves, and update their recovery configuration at any time. Every interaction resets the inactivity timer — proving liveness to the contract.

**3. Stay alive**

If a user wants to prove liveness without moving funds, they call `ping()` — a single cheap storage write that resets the timer.

**4. Recovery triggers**

Chainlink Automation polls `checkUpkeep()` off-chain every ~12 seconds. When a vault's 
inactivity period has elapsed and its balance is non-zero, the Automation node submits 
`performUpkeep()` on-chain via the registered forwarder contract, transferring the ETH 
to the backup address. 

**5. Failed recovery**

If a backup address cannot receive ETH (e.g. a contract that rejects transfers), the failure is counted. After `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS` consecutive failures, the vault is deregistered but the balance remains fully accessible — the user can still `send()` or `withdrawAll()` at any time, and can re-register but with a new backup address.

**6. Cancel anytime**

Users can call `cancelRecovery()` at any time to withdraw their full balance and deregister from monitoring in a single transaction.

## Immutable variables

| Immutable variable | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MIN_INACTIVITY_PERIOD` | 180 days (5 minutes for testnet) | Minimum inactivity period users are allowed to configure |
| `MAX_INACTIVITY_PERIOD` | 3650 days | Maximum allowed inactivity period to prevent permanent fund lockup |
| `MAX_CHECK_UPKEEP_SIZE` | 5,000 | Maximum wallets scanned per `checkUpkeep` call (off-chain simulation, no gas constraint) |
| `MAX_PERFORM_UPKEEP_SIZE` | 50 | Maximum wallets recovered per `performUpkeep` call (on-chain execution, gas-bound) |
| `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS` | 3 | Consecutive failed recovery attempts before a vault is permanently abandoned |
| `CURSOR_ADVANCE_INTERVAL` | 1 hour | Minimum time between idle cursor advances when no wallets are due |

## Chainlink Automation Setup

After deployment:

1. Go to [automation.chain.link](https://automation.chain.link) and connect your wallet
2. Click **Register new upkeep** → select **Custom Logic**
3. Set the target contract to your deployed `AeternumVault` address
4. `checkData` should be empty
5. Set gas limit to `500000`
6. Fund the upkeep with LINK tokens from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link) (Sepolia)
7. After registration, open your upkeep details and copy the **Forwarder** address
8. Call `setForwarder(forwarderAddress)` on your deployed contract — this permanently locks
   `performUpkeep` so only Chainlink's forwarder can call it. This can only be set once.

## Security

### Design Principles

- **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** enforced on all ETH-transferring paths
- **ReentrancyGuard** applied as a secondary defence layer on all state-changing functions
- **No admin backdoors** — the contract contains no owner or privileged roles capable of pausing recovery, redirecting funds, or accessing user balances
- **Chainlink forwarder gating** — once `setForwarder()` is called post-deployment, 
  `performUpkeep()` rejects all callers except the designated Chainlink Automation 
  forwarder address. The setter is callable exactly once and locks permanently.
- **Stale `performData` safety** — `_executeRecovery` re-validates every wallet before acting; stale or already-recovered entries are silently skipped
- **O(1) registry removal** — swap-and-pop with 1-indexed mappings prevents array corruption during batch removals
- **Failed recovery handling** — after `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS` consecutive failures, the vault is abandoned and balance remains self-claimable
- **Direct ETH transfer rejection** — `receive()` explicitly reverts, preventing accidental ETH loss

### Known Considerations

- `block.timestamp` is used for inactivity comparisons. Validator manipulation is bounded to ~12 seconds — negligible for inactivity periods measured in days and months.
- External ETH transfers inside a loop in `performUpkeep` are acknowledged (Slither: calls-loop). Mitigated by `nonReentrant`, CEI pattern, re-validation per iteration, and `MAX_PERFORM_UPKEEP_SIZE`
- `_executeRecovery` restores state after a failed ETH transfer (Slither: reentrancy-eth). 
  Silenced and acknowledged — exploitation is prevented by `nonReentrant` on `performUpkeep`, 
  balance zeroing before the call, and permanent abandonment after 3 consecutive failures.
